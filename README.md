# Bike Sharing

## Overview

Using Stories in Tableau Public, a pitch deck was created for angel-funding a bike sharing start-up. With this in mind, we analyzed a dataset with that included the New York market to discover meaningful trends during August month.

### 1. Peak Hours
New York represnts one of the bisggest cities in the world and becasue it can be used as a large sample for our market analysis this city was selected. In the following caption, we can observe that the the peak hours are around from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm, infering that in August, the people in NYC generally, use the bike to go from their workplaces to their homes.

### 2. Heatmap
Going deeper, we can see this same pattern in the heatmap below. Where Thursday is the weekday with the most afflunce/use of bikes in NYC from 5:00 to 8:00 pm. On the other hand, we can see another trend on Saturdays and Sundays, although more evenly distributed, during 10:00 am to 6:00 pm and are men who use it more frequently.

### 3. Customers / UserTypes
On the other hand, the User Types are distributed as following. 81.07% as recurring customer (Subscriber) and 18.93% as one time users (Customers). Meaning that the engament  is pretty high, and wherever the bikesharing business is created it would be imperative  to incentivize people to become subscribers. So, we would need to focus on keeping the male audience and bringing more women into the bike usage to increase the revenue.

### 4. Trip Duration
By analyzing the following chart, we can observe that the mean bike usage is around 5-7 minutes with as much of 110 K bikes used by males, 33 K bikes used by females and around 8 K bikes used by peooplethat didn't define thier sex. After these 5-7 minutes the usage fell sharply for both women and men, until is almost zero bikes being used for rides greater than 45 minutes.

### 5. Top Start and Top End Locations

The last aspect to analyze is the spread the Top Start and Top End Locations. Either in NYC or in wherever the city the start-up is going to be launched, there is always areas more populated and more visited areas than others, if possible, we could think provide price incentives for less populated areas.

## Summary

With the insights extracted from our dataset these could be used to engage more customers or even convert customers into subscribers for both genders. Two additional vizualizations that I would add are:

a. Chart that identifies rides by age and sex, to properly foucus our marketing efforts.

b. Chart that identify how long a suscriber mantains its subscription to verify if our subscribers are really compounding or not.
